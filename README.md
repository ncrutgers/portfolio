# Responsive Portfolio

The porfolio application bases its structure in responsive design where it renders according to the screen or window size.

Implemented using Bootstrap CSS Framework and Google Developer tools:

* Components for initial setup of pages
* Grid system to define a clear layout of components
* Utilities to customize padding and margins
* Dev tools to test responsiveness

Styling was also set by use of Bootstrap Utilities classes.
